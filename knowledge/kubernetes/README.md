# 🏗️ Kubernetes Architecture

A Kubernetes environment can be broadly divided into two major areas:

```text
                    Kubernetes Cluster
                           |
            +--------------+--------------+
            |                             |
       Control Plane                  Worker Nodes
            |                             |
    +-------+-------+              +------+------+
    |       |       |              |             |
 API     Scheduler Controllers    Kubelet    Container
Server                  Manager                 Runtime
    |                                   |
  etcd                              Pods
